This repo summerize the work we've done in collaboration with EverCompliant company, as a final projet of the course 'Applied Data Science with Python' (BIU, summer 2019 by dr. Omri Allouche). 

[EverCompliant](https://evercompliant.com) is a leading provider of cyber risk intelligence and transaction laundering ldtection and prevention. One of the major tools that the company uses is a classification model, that categorize web pages according to their textual content. For time to time, this model requairs re-train, in order to improve preformance or to be update with the changing environment and so on. For this training, we need labaled data. But labeling is expensive. 

To get an overview of what we've done, read our [project paper](ProjectPaper.ipynb)!

For a more detailed description of each step, see [Notebooks](Notebooks/README.rm).

And finally, feel free to use/contribute the [Code](Code/README.rm).
